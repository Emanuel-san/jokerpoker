An attempt at a traditional joker poker machine.

The project was for a course at Högskolan på Åland called Laboration 1 where you plan and present a project with goals, code, UML and a report.

My main goal with this project was to learn something new and not use the language C which was the only language we had studied untill this course
so I decided to do this in Rust since it might be one of the modern languages used more and more further in the future as it develops.

Initially I wanted to make it with a graphical interface using Bevy, however my conclusion was that with my still limited knowledge of Rust and the complexity of both Rust and Bevy
this was to much of a task in the limited timespan i had in both learning the language and the game engine.

The end result was that I did the logic and my own graphical render in the command line.

Link below is my final report of the project available in swedish only.
